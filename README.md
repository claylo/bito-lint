**bito** = **b**uilding **i**n **t**he **o**pen.

AI coding agents generate documentation as they work — ADRs, design docs, changelogs, handoff notes. The quality varies between sessions. Sometimes you get crisp, well-structured prose. Sometimes you get bloated walls of text that no one wants to review.

bito-lint catches the problems before you commit. It runs 18 deterministic writing checks — readability scoring, token budgets, section completeness, grammar, dialect enforcement, and style analysis. No LLM, no API calls, no network. Same input, same result, every time.

The goal: agent-generated documents that are clean enough to ship.

```
$ bito-lint analyze docs/architecture.md

docs/architecture.md

  Readability: Grade 12.4, 24 sentences, 390 words
  Grammar:     8 issues, 3 passive (12.5%)
  Sticky:      Glue index 21.5%, 2 sticky sentences
  Pacing:      Fast 62% / Medium 29% / Slow 8%
  Length:      Avg 15.8 words, variety 10.0/10
  Transitions: 0% of sentences, 0 unique
  Overused:    "template" (1.3%), "skill" (1.1%), "design" (1.1%)
  Diction:     2 vague words
  Style:       Score 92/100, 2 adverbs, 0 hidden verbs
```

## What it checks

**`analyze`** runs 18 checks in one pass:

| Category | What it catches |
|----------|----------------|
| Readability | Flesch-Kincaid grade level — flag documents that demand too much of the reader |
| Grammar | Passive voice, double negatives, subject-verb disagreement, missing punctuation |
| Sticky sentences | High "glue word" density — sentences stuffed with *is*, *the*, *of*, *in* |
| Pacing | Monotonous sentence rhythm — all short punches or all long slogs |
| Sentence variety | Length distribution — a score of 1/10 means every sentence is the same length |
| Transitions | Percentage of sentences using connective phrases — low means choppy reading |
| Overused words | Repeated non-trivial words that make the text feel circular |
| Repeated phrases | Bigrams and trigrams that recur too often |
| Echoes | Same word appearing in adjacent sentences (unintentional repetition) |
| Complex paragraphs | Paragraphs with too many ideas competing for attention |
| Conjunction starts | Sentences opening with *But*, *And*, *So* — fine in moderation, a tic in excess |
| Cliches | "At the end of the day," "move the needle," "low-hanging fruit" |
| Diction | Vague words (*things*, *stuff*, *very*) that add length without meaning |
| Sensory language | Percentage of concrete, sensory words — useful for judging descriptive writing |
| Consistency | Mixed US/UK spelling (*color* and *colour* in the same document) |
| Dialect enforcement | Flag spellings that violate your project's chosen dialect (en-us, en-gb, en-ca, en-au) |
| Acronyms | Tracks acronym usage for consistency |
| Style score | Combined metric: adverb density, hidden verbs (nominalizations), overall polish |

Every check is deterministic. No API calls, no LLM, no network. The same input produces the same output every time.

**Focused checks** run individually when you need a specific gate:

```bash
# Does this handoff fit in 2,000 tokens?
$ bito-lint tokens handoff.md --budget 2000
PASS: handoff.md is 546 tokens (budget: 2000)

# Is this user guide accessible to a general audience?
$ bito-lint readability getting-started.md --max-grade 8
Error: getting-started.md scores 14.7 (max: 8). Simplify sentences or reduce jargon.

# Does this ADR have all the sections it needs?
$ bito-lint completeness docs/decisions/0001-my-decision.md --template adr
PASS: docs/decisions/0001-my-decision.md (adr completeness check)

# How's the grammar?
$ bito-lint grammar changelog.md
changelog.md: 16 sentences analyzed
  Passive voice: 2 instances (12.5%)
  Grammar issues: 3
    [MEDIUM] Sentence 3: Possible comma splice
    [LOW] Sentence 9: Multiple consecutive spaces found
    [MEDIUM] Sentence 16: Sentence missing terminal punctuation
```

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew install claylo/brew/bito-lint
```

### From source

```bash
cargo install bito-lint
```

### Pre-built binaries

Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/claylo/bito-lint/releases). Binaries are available for macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), Linux (x86_64 and ARM64), and Windows.

## Usage

### Full analysis

```bash
bito-lint analyze my-document.md
```

Add `--json` for machine-readable output. Add `--dialect en-gb` to enforce British spelling. Add `--checks readability,consistency` to run only specific checks.

### Quality gates

Quality gates are pass/fail checks designed for CI, pre-commit hooks, and automation:

```bash
# Token counting with budget enforcement
bito-lint tokens <file> --budget <max>

# Readability with grade ceiling
bito-lint readability <file> --max-grade <max>

# Section completeness against a template
bito-lint completeness <file> --template <name>

# Grammar and passive voice analysis
bito-lint grammar <file>
```

Built-in completeness templates: `adr`, `handoff`, `design-doc`. Define your own in a bito-lint config file.

Every command exits non-zero on failure, writes structured JSON with `--json`, and works in pipes.

### Dialect enforcement

Set a project dialect and bito-lint flags wrong-dialect spellings alongside mixed-spelling inconsistencies:

```bash
# Via flag
bito-lint analyze README.md --dialect en-us

# Via environment variable
export BITO_LINT_DIALECT=en-gb

# Via config file (.bito-lint.toml)
dialect = "en-ca"
```

Supported dialects: `en-us`, `en-gb`, `en-ca` (Canadian hybrid: US *-ize/-ise*, UK for the rest), `en-au`.

### MCP server

bito-lint includes a built-in [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, so AI coding assistants can call quality gates directly during writing sessions:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bito-lint": {
      "command": "bito-lint",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

This exposes six tools: `analyze_writing`, `count_tokens`, `check_readability`, `check_completeness`, `check_grammar`, and `get_info`. Total schema cost: ~1,283 tokens. See [docs/mcp-development.md](docs/mcp-development.md) for context budget details.

## Configuration

Drop a config file in your project and it takes effect automatically:

1. `.bito-lint.toml` (or `.yaml`, `.json`) in the current directory or any parent
2. `bito-lint.toml` (without dot prefix) in the current directory or any parent
3. `~/.config/bito-lint/config.toml` (user-wide defaults)

Closer files win. All formats (TOML, YAML, JSON) work interchangeably.

```toml
# .bito-lint.toml
dialect = "en-us"
token_budget = 2000
max_grade = 12.0
log_level = "warn"
```

## Shell completions

Included in Homebrew installs and release archives. For manual setup:

```bash
# Bash
bito-lint completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/bito-lint

# Zsh
bito-lint completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_bito-lint

# Fish
bito-lint completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/bito-lint.fish
```
